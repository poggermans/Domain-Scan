# Domain-Scan.
Simple script that scans domains

This script is for educational purpose ONLY. I am not liable for what you do with it.

Tested on kali linux.

Install:
Download domain_scan.sh and cd to the directory you installed it in
chmod +x domain_scan.sh
./domain_scan.sh

Modes:
1 non aggressive
2 aggressive

Extra:
Outputs all information in the terminal, if you wish to save the output run it with ./domain_scan.sh | tee your_file_name.txt
also don't bother with the install option, I'm too lazy to remove it so I reccommend manually installing the things in the list.

Enjoy!
